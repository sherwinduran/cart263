## Artists' Statement
Our project is a fun and interactive trivia quiz video game where players guess logos from different video games. We wanted to make something competitive and fast-paced to keep players engaged. Since we both enjoy playing video games, we thought that it would be a great idea to turn that into a quiz game for our project.

To build our quiz game, we made the structure in a clean and organized way. Instead of making a separate HTML element for each question, we used arrays in JavaScript to store the questions, which made everything easier to manage. We also added sound effects for right and wrong answers, and included the sources for those sounds in our JavaScript file, along with the images of the video game logos.

We also added a timer so the players can feel the pressure and stay focused. We then included a progress bar to show how far along the users are in the quiz. As it goes up, it reflects how many questions the users have answered correctly. We used CSS to style the buttons so that they can stand out and look clickable, this helps the players know what to do next. We had a little trouble setting the background image at first, but Sabine was able to figure it out and fix it.

## Changes/Feedbacks From Peers
After our demo presentation, we got great feedbacks from our peers. Some people suggested adding a final score at the end and a reset button, which we thought were great ideas. Ethan and I were able to add both of these features to the game, and we think it really made the project even better.

We also added a fun confetti animation when a player gets the right answer. Sabine suggested that we randomize the questions instead of keeping them in the same order, so we did that too.

We also wanted the game to look really good as well, so we used pixelated fonts that match with the pixel art background image. Sabine also recommended lowering the opacity of the container because it can be too bright, so we made that change to improve the look.
